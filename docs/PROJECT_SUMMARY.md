## 🎯 What We Built

### Phase 1: Basic Underwriting System ✅
- **Structured Rules**: Extracted 20+ underwriting rules into JSON format
- **LangChain Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 powered evaluation engine
- **Sample Data**: 6 diverse applicants (2 accept, 2 deny, 2 adjudicate)
- **Basic Testing**: Simple CLI for individual applicant evaluation

### Phase 2: A/B Testing Framework ✅
- **Rule Variations**: Conservative, Standard, and Liberal rule sets
- **Prompt Variations**: 5 different LLM instruction approaches
- **Statistical Analysis**: Chi-square, t-tests, proportion tests, effect sizes
- **Business Impact**: Loss ratio, processing costs, market share analysis
- **Comprehensive CLI**: Full-featured command-line interface

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Multiple Testing Scenarios
- **Rule-Based A/B Tests**: Compare different underwriting criteria
- **Prompt-Based A/B Tests**: Compare different LLM instruction styles
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Run full test suites with statistical analysis

### 2. Statistical Rigor
- **Significance Testing**: p-values, confidence intervals, effect sizes
- **Multiple Test Types**: Chi-square, t-tests, proportion tests
- **Business Metrics**: ROI, risk assessment, operational impact

### 3. Real-World Applicability
- **Industry Standards**: Based on actual US auto insurance practices
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Follows NAIC guidelines and state requirements
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for production deployment

## 📊 Sample Results

### Conservative vs Liberal Rules Comparison
```
Decision Distribution Changes:
- Accept Rate: +50.0% (5,000 additional monthly policies)
- Deny Rate: -50.0% (5,000 fewer denials)
- Loss Ratio Impact: +0.250 (significant risk increase)
- Risk Level: HIGH
- Recommendation: Gradual rollout with close monitoring
```

### Prompt Template Comparison
```
Conservative vs Liberal Prompts:
- Agreement Rate: 67% (moderate consistency)
- Processing Time: Similar performance
- Decision Bias: Conservative prompt 30% more restrictive
- Recommendation: Use balanced prompt for consistency
```
